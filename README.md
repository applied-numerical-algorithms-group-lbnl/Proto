# Proto
Proto is a middleware layer that allows performance portability in scientific computations on structured grids.  
Proto includes data structures which support embedded boundary (EB) calculations.    Embedded boundary calculations done properly require data to live on a more complex graph structure than simple arrays can support.      

Proto is now in beta release.
1. All documents (including the reference manual) are available to everyone.   
2. All of Proto will be released publicly early in 2020. 
3. If you wish to use proto (as a beta user), we are happy to accommodate you.  Send email to dtgraves@lbl.gov for access.
